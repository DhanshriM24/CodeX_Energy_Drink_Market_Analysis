## Introduction:
CodeX is a German beverage company aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. Recently, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities across India🌍

## Problem Statement:
As a marketing analyst, my task was to convert the survey results from 10,000 respondents into meaningful insights that CodeX's marketing team can utilize to drive actionable strategies. 📝📊

## Task:
Check the “Primary_Secondary_Insights.pdf” and answer the questions by analyzing the data provided. You can use any tool of your choice (Python, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Excel, PowerPoint).<br>
You can add more research questions and answer them in your presentation that suits your recommendations.<br>
The target audience is the Chief Marketing Officer, you have 15 minutes to present insights to him. Make a concise presentation.<br>
Be creative with your presentation, audio/video presentation will have more weightage.<br>
You can use additional data based on your own research to support your recommendations<br>
Please note that it is possible that some respondents might not have answered all the questions sincerely. For instance, a person is more likely to have not tasted the drink if they haven’t heard about it. Sense-check the data and use your judgment to clean it as required.<br>
